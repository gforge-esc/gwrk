# Feature Specification: 001 CLI Core

**Feature Branch**: `001-cli-core`
**Created**: 2026-02-26
**Revised**: 2026-03-06
**Status**: Active (Rewrite v3)
**Input**: gwrk CLI — the TypeScript entry point, hierarchical command routing, flat-file task tracking with Hard Gate enforcement, agent dispatch wrappers, SQLite execution ledger, shell-script orchestration passthroughs, project-aware prompt conditioning, and unified interactive onboarding.

---

## 1. Design Decisions

### Command Taxonomy

The CLI uses a **Foxtrot Charlie pillar-based hierarchy** to organize commands by user intent (Clarity → Throughput → Value).

| Pillar | Category | Commands | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Clarity** | **Define** | `define <feature>`, `define spec`, `define plan`, `define tasks` | Specification, planning, and task decomposition (definition loop) |
| **Throughput**| **Ship** | `ship <feature> <phase>` | Full autonomous shipping lifecycle (branch→implement→review→PR→CI) |
| **Value** | **Measure**| `measure pulse`, `measure effort`, `measure compression` | Productivity, estimation, and ratio reporting |
| **-** | **Task Engine** | `tasks list`, `tasks next`, `tasks done` | Task state management with Hard Gate enforcement |
| **-** | **Data** | `db runs`, `db stats` | SQLite execution ledger queries |
| **-** | **Scaffolding**| `init` | Project onboarding (profile, workstation, Slack, agents) |
| **-** | **Diagnostics** | `project info` | Project profile introspection |

### Architecture Principles

1. **Shell scripts ARE the product.** `define` and `ship` are thin CLI wrappers around `scripts/dev/define-until-solid.sh` and `scripts/dev/work-until-done.sh`. The TS layer adds SQLite run recording, manifest writing, and CLI UX — it does NOT reimplement orchestration logic.
2. **Git-native task state.** `tasks.json` lives in `specs/<feature>/.gwrk/tasks.json` alongside the spec. Branch checkouts carry isolated state.
3. **SQLite is the analytical ledger.** `~/.gwrk/gwrk.db` records execution history for compression tracking and agent routing. It is NOT the source of truth for task state.
4. **Fail-fast config.** Zod validation with no `.default()` calls. Missing config → `process.exit(1)`.
5. **Quiet agent output.** All agent dispatch uses `spawn` with piped stdio, timestamped progress lines, and full output logged to `.runs/`. Agent narration MUST NOT dump raw to the terminal. Callers use `quiet: true` for spinner-only mode.
6. **Private by default.** All local data (SQLite, tasks) and upstream integrations (GitHub visibility) default to private.

## 2. User Scenarios & Acceptance Criteria

### US-001 - Project Initialization (P0) ⭐ **REWRITE (2026-05-30 R3)**
As a PE, I want `gwrk init` to be a comprehensive interactive wizard that provisions everything gwrk needs to operate on this project — project profile, workstation config, Slack channel, agent detection — so that one command gets me fully operational whether this is a new project or an existing one.

**Implements**: FR-001, FR-022, FR-030, FR-031, FR-032

**Acceptance**:
1. `gwrk init` auto-detects project type from filesystem signals and presents for confirmation: "Detected: pnpm-monorepo (typescript). Correct? [Y/n]"
2. Walks through profile sections interactively: stack (language, framework, build, test, package manager), source layout, architecture docs, conventions.
3. Detects installed agent CLIs (`which gemini`, `which claude`, `which codex`) and configures `agents` block.
4. Runs workstation provisioning steps (TCC guidance, SSH key gen, gh auth check) — absorbs former `gwrk setup` behavior.
5. Provisions Slack channel if tokens available: "Slack channel name? [project-name]" → creates via API.
6. Writes complete `.gwrkrc.json` with full project profile.
7. Scaffolds directories: `.gwrk/`, `.gwrk/rules/`, `.specify/templates/`, `specs/`, `~/.gwrk/plugins/{skills,agents,workflows}/`.
8. Seeds skills, workflows, rules, and git hooks from builtins.
9. Registers project in `~/.gwrk/gwrk.db`.
10. Running `gwrk init` again shows current config and offers to update (idempotent).
11. `--non-interactive` flag uses auto-detection for all fields with zero prompts (CI/scripting path).
12. Final output: summary of everything provisioned.

> **Note**: This absorbs former US-021 (`gwrk setup`). The `setup` command is removed. Workstation provisioning steps (TCC, SSH, gh) are integrated as steps within `init`.

### US-002 - Agent Specification (P0)
As a PE, I want `gwrk define spec <feature> [--refs <path>]` to dispatch the `/specify` workflow.

**Implements**: FR-002

**Acceptance**:

### US-006 - Hard Gate Enforcement (P0)
As the ship engine, I want `gwrk tasks done <feature> <taskId>` to execute the gate script and only update state on exit 0.

**Implements**: FR-006

2. Passing gate → exit 0, task marked `completed`, history.jsonl entry appended.
3. Missing gate → exit 1 with `CRITICAL: gates/<taskId>-gate.sh not found`.
4. Already completed → exit 1 with `Task <taskId> already completed`.
5. After success: `tail -1 .gwrk/history.jsonl | jq -r '.taskId'` returns the completed task ID.
6. After success: `tail -1 .gwrk/history.jsonl | jq -r '.toStatus'` returns `completed`.

### US-007 - Status Transition History (P1)
As the compression engine, I want state transitions appended to `.gwrk/history.jsonl`.

**Implements**: FR-007

**Acceptance**:
1. After `gwrk tasks done` succeeds, `tail -1 .gwrk/history.jsonl | jq -r '.taskId'` returns the task ID.

### US-008 - Configuration Validation (P0)
As a developer, I want `.gwrkrc.json` validated by Zod at startup.

**Implements**: FR-008

**Acceptance**:

### US-019 - Execution Manifest Writer (P1)
As a PE, I want every `gwrk ship` and `gwrk define` run to write a structured execution manifest to `specs/<feature>/.gwrk/runs/` so that distributed agents produce durable analytical data via git alone.

**Implements**: FR-019

**Acceptance**:

3. Reports orphaned tasks (manifest exists but task is not `completed`) or regressed tasks (was `completed`, now `open`).
4. Exit 0 if clean, exit 1 with report if issues found.

### US-021 - Workstation Setup (P1) ⭐ **ABSORBED into US-001 (R3)**
_This user story is fully absorbed into US-001 (Project Initialization). The `gwrk setup` command is removed. Workstation provisioning (TCC, SSH, gh) is integrated as interactive steps within `gwrk init`. See US-001 acceptance criteria 4._

**Implements**: FR-022 (now delivered via FR-001)

**Acceptance**: See US-001.

### US-022 - Help Text Examples (P1)
As a developer, I want every command with arguments to show concrete `Examples:` in `--help` output so I can discover the correct syntax without guessing.

**Implements**: FR-023

**Acceptance**:
1. `gwrk ship --help` shows at least 3 examples.
2. `gwrk define spec --help` shows at least 2 examples.
3. `gwrk define plan --help` shows at least 2 examples.
4. `gwrk define tasks --help` shows at least 2 examples.

11. `gwrk db runs --help` shows at least 2 examples.
12. `gwrk test --help` shows at least 2 examples.

### US-023 - Feature-Arg Consistency (P1)
As a developer, I want all feature-scoped commands to accept feature as the first positional argument after the verb so the CLI feels predictable.

**Implements**: FR-024

**Acceptance**:
1. Every command accepting `<feature>` has it as positional arg 1 (after the subcommand verb if applicable).
2. No command requires feature as a flag or in a non-standard position.
3. Every command accepting `<feature>` calls `resolveFeature()` to resolve prefix aliases (e.g., `001` → `001-cli-core`). Specifically: `define plan`, `define tests`, `db runs`, and `harvest` are currently missing this.
4. `gwrk define plan 001` resolves to `001-cli-core` and succeeds.
5. `gwrk define tests 001` resolves to `001-cli-core` and succeeds.
6. `gwrk db runs 001` resolves to `001-cli-core` and succeeds.

### US-024 - No Duplicate Surfaces (P1)
As a developer, I want each capability exposed through exactly one command path so I'm never confused by overlapping commands with different interfaces.

**Implements**: FR-025

**Acceptance**:
1. `gwrk project gates` is removed. ✅ (Done — 2026-05-07)
2. No two commands provide the same functionality with different argument syntax.

### US-025 - CLI Grammar Governance (P1)
As a maintainer, I want a documented CLI grammar standard so new commands are consistent by default.

**Implements**: FR-026

**Acceptance**:
1. `docs/governance/cli-grammar.md` exists.
2. Documents the canonical grammar: `gwrk <verb> [subverb] <feature> [phase] [--options]`.
3. Lists all current commands with their argument patterns.
4. Defines the rules for adding new commands.

### US-026 - Define Pillar Output Parity (P0) ⭐ **NEW (2026-05-13)**
As a PE, I want all `define` subcommands (`define spec`, `define plan`, `define tasks`, `define tests`) to have the same quiet, logged output as `ship` — no raw agent narration in the terminal, progress via spinner or timestamped summary lines, full output in `.runs/` log files — so that the CLI presents a consistent, professional UX across all Foxtrot Charlie pillars.

**Implements**: FR-028, FR-029

**Acceptance**:
1. `gwrk define spec 001` shows a spinner or timestamped summary lines, not raw agent narration.
2. `gwrk define tests 003 --force` shows a spinner, not hundreds of lines of agent thinking.
3. Agent output is written to `.runs/` log file for debugging.
4. When an agent commits work natively but returns prose instead of JSON, the command exits 0 (not 1).
5. `gwrk define plan 001` and `gwrk define tasks 001` follow the same pattern.

### US-027 - Project Profile Auto-Detection (P0) ⭐ **NEW (2026-05-30 R3)**
As a PE, I want gwrk to auto-detect my project's tech stack, source layout, and build system from filesystem signals, so that workflows produce correct artifacts without manual configuration.

**Implements**: FR-030, FR-031

**Acceptance**:
1. **Given** a project with `package.json` containing `"workspaces"` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, **When** auto-detection runs, **Then** profile resolves: `type: "pnpm-monorepo"`, `stack.packageManager: "pnpm"`, `stack.testFramework` from devDependencies.
2. **Given** a project with `Cargo.toml`, **When** auto-detection runs, **Then** profile resolves: `type: "rust-workspace"` or `"rust-binary"`, `stack.language: "rust"`, `stack.buildSystem: "cargo"`.
3. **Given** a project with `pyproject.toml`, **When** auto-detection runs, **Then** profile resolves: `type: "python-package"`, `stack.language: "python"`, `stack.testFramework` from `[tool.pytest]` or `[tool.tox]`.
4. **Given** a project with `docs/architecture.md` (gwrk-specific), **When** auto-detection runs, **Then** profile resolves: `type: "gwrk-native"`.
5. **Given** an empty directory, **When** auto-detection runs, **Then** profile resolves: `type: "unknown"`. No error.
6. **Given** explicit profile in `.gwrkrc.json` AND auto-detection results, **When** profile resolves, **Then** explicit config wins on every field; auto-detected fields fill gaps.
7. Auto-detection runs on every workflow invocation as a fallback when `.gwrkrc.json` profile fields are missing.

### US-028 - Project-Aware Prompt Conditioning (P0) ⭐ **NEW (2026-05-30 R3)**
As a PE, I want the resolved project profile injected into every workflow prompt, so that `define plan`, `ship`, and `review` produce artifacts grounded in my project's actual architecture — not gwrk's.

**Implements**: FR-033, FR-034

**Acceptance**:
1. **Given** a pnpm monorepo profile, **When** `gwrk define plan` runs, **Then** the prompt contains a `<project_profile>` XML block with detected type, stack, and layout. Plan references `apps/` and `packages/` — NOT `src/commands/`.
2. **Given** a `gwrk-native` profile, **When** any workflow runs, **Then** all current gwrk-native prompt sections are included verbatim. No behavioral regression.
3. **Given** a non-gwrk project, **When** `gwrk ship` UAT runs, **Then** review evaluates the project's commands — NOT gwrk CLI commands. No ADR-004, no `[exit:N|Xs]` checks.
4. **Given** a non-gwrk project, **When** `gwrk ship` author-gates runs, **Then** gate patterns match the project's test framework (jest, pytest, cargo test) — NOT vitest-only.
5. All 15 PROMPT.md files are refactored: gwrk-native sections gated behind `type: "gwrk-native"`, generic sections for everything else.

### US-029 - Project Profile Introspection (P1) ⭐ **NEW (2026-05-30 R3)**
As a PE, I want `gwrk project info` to show me what gwrk thinks my project is, so that I can debug prompt contamination when it happens.

**Implements**: FR-035

**Acceptance**:
1. `gwrk project info` shows: type, stack (all fields), layout, architecture docs found/missing, conditioning mode (gwrk-native vs generic), source of each field (auto-detected vs explicit).
2. `--format json` returns valid JSON matching `ProjectProfileSchema`. Pipeable to jq.

- **FR-022**: ⭐ **ABSORBED into FR-001 (R3)** Workstation provisioning (TCC, SSH, gh auth, `setup.json`) is now delivered as interactive steps within `gwrk init`. The standalone `gwrk setup` command is removed. Ship pre-flight still checks `~/.gwrk/setup.json`. (US-001)
- **FR-023**: Every command with arguments MUST include an `Examples:` section in `--help` output. (US-022)

Existing `.gwrkrc.json` files MUST continue to parse without error. Explicit config overrides auto-detection field-by-field. (US-027)
- **FR-033**: ⭐ **NEW (2026-05-30 R3)** Inject `<project_profile>` XML block into every workflow prompt at `WorkflowRuntime.executeWorkflow()`, BEFORE the prompt is sent to the agent. Single integration point for all workflows. (US-028)
- **FR-034**: ⭐ **NEW (2026-05-30 R3)** Refactor all 15 PROMPT.md files: architecture references, source layouts, build/test commands, and protocol references (ADR-004, agent-native) MUST be gated behind `type: "gwrk-native"`. Non-gwrk profiles get generic "detect from project" language. (US-028)
- **FR-035**: ⭐ **NEW (2026-05-30 R3)** `gwrk project info` — display resolved profile with: type, stack, layout, architecture, conventions, conditioning mode (gwrk-native vs generic), source of each field (auto vs explicit). Supports `--format json`. (US-029)

## 4. Data Model

### DM-001: Task State (`specs/<feature>/.gwrk/tasks.json`)

```typescript
interface TaskState {
  featureId: string;
  createdAt: string;          // ISO 8601
  phases: Phase[];
}

interface Phase {
  id: string;                 // "phase-01"
  title: string;
  tasks: Task[];
}

interface Task {
  id: string;                 // "T001"
  title: string;
  description: string;
  status: "open" | "in_progress" | "completed";
  gateScript: string;         // "gates/T001-gate.sh"
  completedAt?: string;
}
```

### DM-002: History Log (`.gwrk/history.jsonl`) — **DEPRECATED**

Append-only JSONL per state transition. Superseded by `gwrk.db history` table and `git log --follow tasks.json`. Will be removed once `gwrk harvest` is operational. See [ADR-003](file:///Users/gonzo/Code/gwrk/docs/decisions/ADR-003-state-contract.md).

### DM-005: Execution Manifest (`specs/<feature>/.gwrk/runs/*.json`)

Git-tracked structured JSON per agent run. See [ADR-003](file:///Users/gonzo/Code/gwrk/docs/decisions/ADR-003-state-contract.md) §3 for full schema.

```typescript
interface ExecutionManifest {
  runId: string;          // "2026-03-08T14:02:33Z_ship_p01"
  feature: string;
  phase: string;
  command: string;        // "ship" | "define"
  agent: string;          // "gemini" | "claude" | "codex" | "codex-cloud"
  model: string;
  startedAt: string;      // ISO 8601
  finishedAt: string;
  durationS: number;
  exitCode: number;
  attempt: number;
  gateResult?: string;
  reviewVerdict?: string;
  filesChanged?: number;
  linesAdded?: number;
  linesDeleted?: number;
  gitCommit: string;
  gitBranch: string;
}
```

### DM-003: Configuration (`.gwrkrc.json`) ⭐ **EXTENDED (R3)**

Validated by Zod at startup. No defaults. Extended with optional project profile fields.

```typescript
interface GwrkConfig {
  project: {
    name: string;
    githubRepo?: string;
    slack?: {
      channelId?: string;
      channelName?: string;
      opsChannelId?: string;
      opsChannelName?: string;
      webhookUrl?: string;
    };
    // R3: Project Profile (all optional — auto-detected if missing)
    type?: string;             // e.g., "pnpm-monorepo", "gwrk-native", "python-package", "unknown"
    stack?: {
      language?: string;       // e.g., "typescript", "python", "rust"
      framework?: string;      // e.g., "next.js", "fastify", "django"
      buildSystem?: string;    // e.g., "turbo", "tsc", "cargo"
      testFramework?: string;  // e.g., "vitest", "jest", "pytest"
      packageManager?: string; // e.g., "pnpm", "npm", "yarn", "cargo", "pip"
    };
    layout?: {
      sourceRoot?: string;     // e.g., "src/", "apps/", "lib/"
      apps?: string;           // e.g., "apps/"
      packages?: string;       // e.g., "packages/"
      specs?: string;          // e.g., "specs/"
      docs?: string;           // e.g., "docs/"
    };
    architecture?: {
      doc?: string;            // e.g., "docs/architecture.md", "ARCHITECTURE.md"
      decisions?: string;      // e.g., "docs/decisions/", "docs/adr/"
    };
    conventions?: {
      branchPrefix?: string;   // e.g., "feat/", "feature/"
      testPattern?: string;    // e.g., "*.test.ts", "test_*.py", "*_test.go"
    };
  };
  agents: {
    define: "gemini" | "claude" | "codex";
    implement: "gemini" | "claude" | "codex" | "codex-cloud";
  };
  server?: { ... };
  parallelism?: { ... };
}
```

All `project.type`, `project.stack`, `project.layout`, `project.architecture`, `project.conventions` fields are optional. Missing → auto-detected at runtime. Explicit → overrides auto-detection.

### DM-004: SQLite Execution Ledger (`~/.gwrk/gwrk.db`)

Tables: `projects`, `runs`, `history`. WAL mode. Managed by `better-sqlite3`.

## 5. Technical Constraints

- **TC-001**: Sequential task IDs (`T001`, `T002`). No UUIDs.
- **TC-002**: Air-gapped CLI. No network calls. Agents handle network.
- **TC-003**: Fail-fast config. No `.default()`.
- **TC-004**: Hard Gates. Only `gwrk tasks done` can mutate task state.
- **TC-005**: TypeScript only. No `.js` in `src/`.
- **TC-006**: ESM (ES2022).
- **TC-007**: Branch-scoped state. `tasks.json` lives with the spec.
- **TC-008**: Quiet agent output. `spawn` with piped stdio, timestamped progress lines to terminal, full output to `.runs/` log file. No raw agent narration on stdout.
- **TC-009**: ⭐ **NEW (R3)** Single prompt integration point. Profile injection happens in `WorkflowRuntime.executeWorkflow()` and `ship-orchestrator.ts` review dispatch. No workflow-by-workflow injection logic.
- **TC-010**: ⭐ **NEW (R3)** Backward compatibility. gwrk operating on its own codebase MUST produce identical prompt assembly to pre-R3 behavior. Hard regression gate.
- **TC-011**: ⭐ **NEW (R3)** Schema extension backward compat. `GwrkConfigSchema` with new optional fields MUST parse existing `.gwrkrc.json` files without error.

## 7. Success Criteria

- **SC-001**: `gwrk --help` shows exactly the settled hierarchy. No stubs. No dead commands.
- **SC-002**: `gwrk tasks done` enforces gates strictly — failing gate NEVER updates state.
- **SC-003**: `gwrk define <feature>` runs the full DUS loop and records the run in SQLite.
- **SC-004**: `gwrk ship <feature> <phase>` runs the full ship lifecycle (branch→implement→review→PR→CI) and records the run in SQLite.
- **SC-005**: `pnpm test` passes with 100% of tests GREEN.
- **SC-006**: `pnpm run build` compiles clean with zero TypeScript errors.
- **SC-007**: Every `ship`/`define` run produces a manifest in `.gwrk/runs/` that survives git push.
- **SC-008**: `gwrk tasks verify <feature>` detects and reports post-merge state corruption.
- **SC-009**: ⭐ **UPDATED (R3)** `gwrk init` provisions profile + workstation + agents + Slack in one interactive flow. `gwrk ship` pre-flight passes. `gwrk setup` is removed.
- **SC-010**: ⭐ **NEW (2026-05-13)** All `define` subcommands produce the same quiet, logged output as `ship`. No raw agent narration in terminal.
- **SC-011**: ⭐ **NEW (R3)** `gwrk define plan` in skills-connection produces a plan with `apps/companion/` paths — not `src/commands/`.
- **SC-012**: ⭐ **NEW (R3)** `gwrk define plan` in the gwrk repo produces identical prompt structure to pre-R3 behavior.
- **SC-013**: ⭐ **NEW (R3)** `gwrk project info --format json` returns a valid `ProjectProfile` in any gwrk-managed project.
- **SC-014**: ⭐ **NEW (R3)** All 15 PROMPT.md files refactored with conditional profile sections. `grep -r` for ungated gwrk-native references returns zero.

## 8. Verification Requirements

- **VR-001**: E2E: `gwrk init` → mock spec/plan → `gwrk tasks generate` → gate pass → `gwrk tasks done` → verify state + history.
- **VR-002**: Negative: `gwrk tasks done` with failing gate → state unchanged, exit 1.
- **VR-003**: Config: remove required field → any gwrk command crashes with Zod error.
- **VR-004**: E2E: `gwrk --help` output matches FR-018 exactly.
- **VR-005**: E2E: `gwrk run plan` with stub spec → `[BLOCKED]` error, exit 1.
- **VR-006**: ⭐ **NEW (R3)** E2E: `gwrk init --non-interactive` in a pnpm monorepo → `.gwrkrc.json` contains auto-detected profile.
- **VR-007**: ⭐ **NEW (R3)** E2E: `gwrk define plan` in skills-connection → plan.md has no gwrk-native references.
- **VR-008**: ⭐ **NEW (R3)** E2E: `gwrk project info` in skills-connection → type: "pnpm-monorepo".
- **VR-009**: ⭐ **NEW (R3)** Snapshot: Pre-R3 gwrk plan prompt matches post-R3 when profile is gwrk-native.
- **VR-010**: ⭐ **NEW (R3)** Audit: `grep -r "src/commands\\|src/engine\\|ADR-004\\|Commander.js\\|better-sqlite3" src/plugins/builtins/workflows/*/PROMPT.md` returns ZERO ungated matches.
